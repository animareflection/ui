# ANIREF Design System & UI Kit

Universal design system and component library for Anima Reflection, powered by [Panda](https://panda-css.com/) and [Ark](https://ark-ui.com/).

## Quick Start

Follow the [prerequisities](docs/usage.md#prerequisites) to install Panda in your project, then follow the [package install instructions](docs/usage.md#from-published-package).

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies: `bun`
2. Start development stack: `bun dev`
   - This will launch the following:
     - [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/) in watch mode
     - [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) in watch mode
     - [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) in development mode (default port: `6006`, e.g. http://localhost:6006)

If you'd like to develop outside of Storybook, as in a dedicated app, follow the [prerequisities](docs/usage.md#prerequisites), then follow the [local usage instructions](docs/usage.md#local).
